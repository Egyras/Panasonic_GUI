# Panasonic GUI to control Panasonic Aquarea air-water pump

Its add-on for current project https://github.com/Egyras/HeishaMon and for people without any home automation system. All values retrieve and heat pump control are done via json functionality in HeishaMon. Application read all data in default 6 second interval and shows in GUI. HeishaMon IP address must be entered in "Settings" page and saved, after re-launch values will apear in GUI. Minimal heat pump control available and will be extended in near future.
